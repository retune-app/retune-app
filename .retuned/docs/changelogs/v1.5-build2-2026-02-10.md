# v1.5 Build 2 — February 10, 2026

## Radiant Bloom Breathing Visualization
- Completely redesigned BreathingCircle with "Radiant Bloom" design: gradient-filled core orb + 4 concentric rings with independent scale/opacity animations.
- Dynamic color intensity: rings shift from dim/muted on exhale to bright/luminous on inhale via smooth color interpolation.
- Inner rings brighten earlier than outer rings for a satisfying ripple effect.

## Inverse Text Breathing Animation
- Phase labels ("Breathe In", "Breathe Out", "Hold") now scale inversely with breathing: shrink on inhale, grow on exhale.
- Countdown numbers stay fixed size for readability.

## Bold Hold Phase Text
- "HOLD" text appears bold (700 weight) during hold phases; inhale/exhale stay light (300 weight).

## Audio Leak Fix
- Fixed bug where audio could continue after session end due to stale React state.
- handleStop now unconditionally stops all audio sources.

## Breathing Circle Centering
- Circle visualization is now properly centered vertically on Breathe home screen on all phone sizes.

## Code Cleanup
- Removed 4 unused imports, 4 unused variables, 15+ unused styles from BreathingScreen.tsx.

## Files Changed
- `client/components/BreathingCircle.tsx`
- `client/screens/BreathingScreen.tsx`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
