nstructions for Replit AI Agents: ReWired App Design Theme
These instructions detail the visual and stylistic elements of the "ReWired" app icon (based on the left image variant, featuring title case "Rewired" text). Use this as a foundational theme to ensure consistency across the entire app's UI/UX design, including screens, buttons, typography, color schemes, and any graphical elements. The overall aesthetic is ultra-minimalist, modern, elegant, calm, and sophisticated—emphasizing high negative space, spiritual renewal (via organic growth motifs), and subtle AI integration (via glowing elements). Avoid clutter, vibrant colors, or overly complex shapes; prioritize restraint and harmony.
1. Core Concept and Symbolism

Main Icon Element: A single, continuous flowing line forming a stylized side-profile of a human head (facing right in the icon view). The line starts from the base (neck/shoulder curve), flows up to define the chin, mouth, nose, forehead, and crown, then organically transitions into a sprouting leaf at the top (crown chakra-inspired position).
The leaf is simple: one primary blade with a subtle vein or secondary lobe, angled slightly upward for a sense of growth and enlightenment.
Line style: Smooth, confident strokes with slight variable thickness (thinner at curves, slightly bolder at structural points for depth). No fills—pure outline/line art.

AI Core Representation: A small, subtle glowing dot (circular, soft-edged) placed at the center of the head (roughly forehead/third-eye position). This symbolizes the AI-powered spiritual core—keep it understated, not dominant.
Composition: High negative space (at least 70-80% empty). Center the icon elements with ample breathing room. For app-wide use, scale this motif subtly (e.g., as loaders, favicons, or background watermarks).
Orientation and Proportions: Head profile is elongated and graceful; leaf extends naturally without overpowering. Maintain a balanced aspect ratio (e.g., square for icons, adaptable for banners).

2. Color Palette

Primary Gradient (Line and Leaf): A subtle linear or radial gradient transitioning from charcoal grey (#333333 or hex #2F2F2F for depth) at the base/neck to muted gold (#BFAF83 or hex #C0A875—soft, antique gold, not bright yellow) at the crown/leaf tip. This evokes "rewiring" from grounded (grey) to enlightened/growth (gold).
Avoid harsh contrasts; use 20-30% opacity blends for smoothness.
For accessibility: Ensure sufficient contrast against backgrounds (WCAG AA compliant, e.g., 4.5:1 ratio).

Glowing Dot: Soft golden-yellow (#FFD700 with 50% opacity glow, or hex #E6B800 for core, with a subtle radial blur/halo in #FFFACD for light emission). Keep glow radius small (5-10% of icon size) to maintain minimalism.
Text Color: Dark charcoal grey (#333333 or #404040) for primary text like "Rewired." For accents, use muted gold (#BFAF83) sparingly (e.g., highlights or active states).
Background: Plain off-white (#F5F5F5 or #FAF9F6—warm ivory, not stark white). Use this as the app's default canvas for screens to promote calm and readability.
Secondary/Accent Colors (for app extension):
Neutral: Light grey (#E0E0E0) for dividers, borders, or inactive elements.
Success/Growth: Subtle green-tinged gold (#A8B07D) for affirmations or progress indicators (tie to leaf motif).
AI/Interactive: Soft blue-grey (#7A8A99) for buttons or AI prompts (subtle nod to tech without clashing).
Error/Warning: Avoid reds; use desaturated brown-grey (#8B7D6B) for gentle alerts.

Palette Guidelines: Limit to 4-6 colors total. All hues should be muted/desaturated (saturation <40%) for a serene, spiritual feel. Test on light/dark modes: Invert to dark off-black (#121212) background with lightened gradients for dark theme.

3. Typography

Primary Font: Clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Manrope, or DM Sans—geometric with good kerning and legibility). Use medium weight (400-500) for body text, bold (600-700) for headings.
For "Rewired": Title case ("Rewired"—capital R, rest lowercase). Size: Proportionate to icon (e.g., 24-32pt below icon in mocks).
Spacing: Generous letter-spacing (0.05-0.1em) for elegance; line-height 1.4-1.6 for readability.

App-Wide Typography Scale:
Headings: 24-36pt, bold, in charcoal grey.
Body/Affirmations: 16-18pt, regular, in charcoal grey.
Subtext/Labels: 12-14pt, light weight, in light grey.
Hierarchy: Use size, weight, and subtle color shifts (e.g., gold for key phrases) to guide focus. No italics or underlining—keep flat.

Consistency: All text should align with the icon's minimalism—avoid decorative fonts. Ensure cross-platform rendering (web/iOS/Android).

4. Style and Layout Guidelines

Minimalism: Embrace whitespace—margins/padding at least 16-24px. No shadows, gradients, or effects unless subtle (e.g., 1px blur on glow).
Animations/Interactions: Subtle fades or growth animations (e.g., leaf sprout on load). Use easing curves (ease-in-out) for calm transitions.
UI Components:
Buttons: Rounded rectangles (8-12px radius), off-white background with charcoal outline; gold fill on hover/active.
Cards/Screens: Borderless or thin grey borders; center content with high negative space.
Icons/Graphics: Reuse head/leaf motif scaled down (e.g., for nav items). Monochrome variants in grey for inactive states.

Accessibility: High contrast, scalable text (min 200%), alt text for images (e.g., "Stylized head with sprouting leaf and AI glow"). Support voice-over for spiritual affirmations.
Branding Extension: Apply theme to splash screens, onboarding, affirmation cards, settings—e.g., background with faint leaf watermark in 5% opacity gold.

5. Implementation Notes for Replit Agents

Tools/Libraries: Use CSS/SVG for icon recreation (export as vector for scalability). For app builds: React Native/Flutter for cross-platform; Tailwind CSS for theme consistency.
Variations: Generate light/dark mode toggles. Test on devices (iPhone previews for App Store compliance).
Iteration: Start with wireframes matching this palette, then refine based on user feedback. Ensure all elements evoke "AI-powered spiritual rewiring"—organic yet tech-infused.
